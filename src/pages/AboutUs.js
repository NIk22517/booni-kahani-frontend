            <h3>PRICING AND TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS</h3>
            <h3>
              Although at boonikahani we strive to provide accurate product and
              pricing information, pricing or typographical errors may occur. In
              the event that a product is listed at an incorrect price or with
              incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product
              information, boonikahani shall have the right to refuse or cancel
              any orders placed for that product listed at the incorrect price.
              boonikahani shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such
              orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit
              card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the
              purchase and your order is cancelled, boonikahani shall
              immediately issue a credit to your credit card account in the
              amount of the charge.

            <h3>CANCELLATION BY boonikahani</h3>
            <h3>
              There may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must
              cancel. boonikahani reserves the right to refuse or cancel any
              order for any reason. Some situations that may result in your
              order being cancelled include limitations on quantities available
              for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing
              information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud
              avoidance department. We may also require additional verifications
              or information before accepting any order. We will contact you if
              all or any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional
              information is required to accept your order. If your order is
              cancelled after your credit card has been charged, the said amount
              will be reversed back in your Card Account.
